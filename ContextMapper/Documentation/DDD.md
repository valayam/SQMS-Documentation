Here's a detailed collection of the necessary information for a project that will follow **Domain-Driven Design (DDD)** principles. This will help gather information on key aspects like domain knowledge, bounded contexts, aggregates, entities, value objects, and services. Each section corresponds to a critical element of a SQMS DDD project.

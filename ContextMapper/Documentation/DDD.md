Here's a detailed Excel format for collecting the necessary information for a project that will follow **Domain-Driven Design (DDD)** principles. This format will help gather information on key aspects like domain knowledge, bounded contexts, aggregates, entities, value objects, and services. Each section corresponds to a critical element of a DDD project.

### Instructions to Use the Form

- **Sheet 1 (Project Overview)**: Gather high-level information about the project, domain experts, and key stakeholders. This provides a snapshot of the project.
  
- **Sheet 2 (Domain Knowledge Collection)**: Collect important domain terms and definitions with the help of domain experts to build the ubiquitous language.

- **Sheet 3 (Bounded Contexts)**: Define each bounded context with descriptions and their categorization (Core, Supporting, Generic).

- **Sheet 4 (Aggregates and Entities)**: Identify all aggregates and their entities, along with relationships.

- **Sheet 5 (Value Objects)**: Document the value objects, what aggregate they belong to, and any validation rules or constraints.

- **Sheet 6 (Domain Services)**: Define the domain services that manage domain logic and interact with entities and aggregates.

- **Sheet 7 (Domain Events)**: Collect domain events that trigger actions within or between bounded contexts.

- **Sheet 8 (Repository Details)**: Define repositories that manage aggregate persistence, along with the methods and technologies used.
